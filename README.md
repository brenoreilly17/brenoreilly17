- 👋 Hi, I’m @brenoreilly17
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, specifically in C++ and Python! Check out my new project called "Therapy Manager". It will help you with any task relating to adding, deleting, viewing, or managing large amounts of data.
- 🌱 I’m currently a second-year student at Vanderbilt University, studying computer science and economics. I'm also on track to graduate one semester early!
- 💞️ I aspire to work in either data engineering, data science, or software engineering post-grad.
