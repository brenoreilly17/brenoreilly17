- 👋 Hi, I’m @brenoreilly17!
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, specifically in C++, Python, and C#! I also have extensive experience with relational databases, like SQL, through my personal projects & tech internship at UPS. Check out my new project called "Therapy Manager". It will help you with any task relating to adding, deleting, viewing, or managing large amounts of data.
- 🌱 I’m a rising third-year student at Vanderbilt University, majoring in computer science & economics and minoring in business & Spanish. I'm also on track to graduate one semester early!
- 💞️ I aspire to work in data engineering, data science, or software engineering post-grad - anything pertaining to data or programming interests me.
